# **LanchoneteApp**

LanchoneteApp is a full-stack volunteer project developed using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. The main objective of the project is to centralize all the snacks with their prices to solve the problem of not knowing the price of a particular snack or even forgetting it. LanchoneteApp lists all the products with their images, names, and prices. Currently, the project only has the functionality to add products, but there are plans for future implementations to update and delete snack data.
